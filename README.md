# Getting Started With GitHub Finder

This project was done to solidify my recently gotten, 26 Sept 2021, knowledge of a javascript framework, React.js. <br/>
It was really nice working with third-party API's and i'll probably experiment more on that. Now to the main project.

### This project is not a project i'm proud of, so it's open source 🙂.

Next stop, state management systems and more complex react projects that won't be opensourced 🚴‍♂️.
